window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Foreword by Bill Gates</b></p> <p>LinkedIn cofounder, legendary investor, and host of the award-winning <i>Masters of Scale</i> podcast reveals the secret to starting and scaling massively valuable companies.</p> <p>What entrepreneur or founder doesn't aspire to build the next Amazon, Facebook, or Airbnb? Yet those who actually manage to do so are exceedingly rare. So what separates the start-ups that get disrupted and disappear from the ones who grow to become global giants? The secret is blitzscaling: a set of techniques for scaling up at a dizzying pace that blows competitors out of the water.&nbsp;</p> <p>The objective of blitzscaling is not to go from zero to one but from one to one billion as quickly as possible. When growing at a breakneck pace, getting to next level requires very different strategies from those that got you to where you are today. In a book inspired by their popular class at Stanford Business School, Hoffman and Yeh reveal how to navigate the necessary shifts and weather the unique challenges that arise at each stage of a company's life cycle, such as: how to design business models for igniting and sustaining relentless growth; strategies for hiring and managing; how the role of the founder and company culture must evolve as the business matures, and more.</p> <p>Whether your business has 10 employees or 10,000, <i>Blitzscaling</i> is the essential playbook for winning in a world where speed is the only competitive advantage that matters.&nbsp;</p>";
