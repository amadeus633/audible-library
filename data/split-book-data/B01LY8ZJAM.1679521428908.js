Through personal stories and real-life conversations, Jonathan Raymond takes you into the room with managers and employees where real culture change happens and shows you a new kind of employee mentoring where each person gets the real-time feedback, support, and clear boundaries we all need to get beyond the patterns that hold us back. </p> <p>In this provocative and timely new book, Jonathan brings together what he has learned over a 20-year journey as an executive, an entrepreneur, a team leader, and a leadership trainer.
