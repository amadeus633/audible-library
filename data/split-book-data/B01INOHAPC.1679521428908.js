window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>At the peak of his career and success, Ari Meisel nearly killed himself from exhaustion and overwork. </p> <p>He had to make a choice: He could let his \"success\" destroy him physically and mentally, or he could find a better way to live. He spent the next few years redesigning his life from scratch. </p> <p>Ultimately he found the way to reduce his workload by 80 percent while actually increasing results and success. Furthermore, he could spend time on what matters most: his family. </p> <p>This book describes his method. </p> <p>Using Meisel's revolutionary Optimize, Automate, Outsource approach, you will learn how to take almost anything you do and make it work smarter instead of harder. Modern methods like the 80/20 rule, the 3 D's, and multiplatform repurposing let you build a high-powered, traditional-style \"success factory\" that requires only one employee to run. </p> <p>Less work, more results, more happiness. </p>";
