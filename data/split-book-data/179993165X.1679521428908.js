window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“Read this book, strengthen your resolve, and help us all return to reason.” —JORDAN PETERSON</b></p> <p><b>There’s a war against truth … and if we don’t win it, intellectual freedom will be a casualty.</b></p> <p>The West’s commitment to freedom, reason, and true liberalism have become endangered by a series of viral forces in our society today. Renowned host of the popular YouTube show <i>The Saad Truth</i>, Dr. Gad Saad exposes how an epidemic of idea pathogens are spreading like a virus and killing common sense in the West.</p> <p>Serving as a powerful follow-up to Jordan Peterson’s book <i>12 Rules for Life</i>, Dr. Saad unpacks what is really happening in progressive safe zones, why we need to be paying more attention to these trends, and what we must do to stop the spread of dangerous thinking. A professor at Concordia University who has witnessed this troubling epidemic first-hand, Dr. Saad dissects a multitude of these concerning forces (corrupt thought patterns, belief systems, attitudes, etc.) that have given rise to a stifling political correctness in our society and how these have created serious consequences that must be remedied—before it’s too late.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
