window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Composed in four parts between 1883 and 1885, <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i> is the most famous and influential work of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. The work is a philosophical novel in which the character of Zarathustra, a religious prophet-like figure, delivers a series of lessons and sermons in a Biblical style that articulate the central ideas of Nietzsche's mature thought. Key to the philosophy of <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i> is a rejection of traditional systems of religious morality, the idea of the will to power, and a vision of a new, higher mode of being, the ubermensch\" or \"Superman,\" one of Nietzsche's most famous and controversial figures. As innovative stylistically as it is philosophically, <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i> is both a literary masterpiece and an enduring classic of moral thought. This version of <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i> is the translation by Thomas Common.</p>";
