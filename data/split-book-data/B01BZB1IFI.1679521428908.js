window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As cyber attacks dominate front-page news, as hackers join the list of global threats, and as top generals warn of a coming cyber war, few books are more timely and enlightening than <i>Dark Territory: The Secret History of Cyber War</i> by <i>Slate</i> columnist and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Fred Kaplan. </p> <p>Kaplan probes the inner corridors of the National Security Agency, the beyond-top-secret cyber units in the Pentagon, the \"information warfare\" squads of the military services, and the national security debates in the White House to tell this never-before-told story of the officers, policymakers, scientists, and spies who devised this new form of warfare and who have been planning - and, more often than people know, fighting - these wars for decades. </p> <p>From the 1991 Gulf War to conflicts in Haiti, Serbia, Syria, the former Soviet republics, Iraq, and Iran, where cyber warfare played a significant role, <i>Dark Territory</i> chronicles, in fascinating detail, an unknown past that shines an unsettling light on our future. </p>";
