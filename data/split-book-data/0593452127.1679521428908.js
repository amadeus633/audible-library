window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> Best Seller</b></p> <p><b>From the world’s foremost expert on power and strategy comes a daily devotional designed to help you seize your destiny.</b></p> <p>Robert Greene, the number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author, has been the consigliere to millions for more than two decades. Now, with entries that are drawn from his five books, plus never-before-published works, <i>The Daily Laws</i> offers a page of refined and concise wisdom for each day of the year, in an easy-to-digest lesson that will only take a few minutes to absorb. Each day features a Daily Law as well - a prescription that listeners cannot afford to ignore in the battle of life. Each month centers around a major theme: power, seduction, persuasion, strategy, human nature, toxic people, self-control, mastery, psychology, leadership, adversity, or creativity.</p> <p>Who doesn’t want to be more powerful? More in control? The best at what they do? The secret: Listen to this book every day.</p> <p>“Daily study,” Leo Tolstoy wrote in 1884, is “necessary for all people.” More than just an introduction for new fans, this book is a Rosetta stone for internalizing the many lessons that fill Greene’s books and will reward a lifetime of reading and rereading.</p>";
