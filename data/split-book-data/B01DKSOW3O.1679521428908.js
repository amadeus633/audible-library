They are also experiencing a need for meaningful connection and community.\" </p> <p>The membership-based business is a problem solver for both businesses and individuals. It spares people from the duties of ownership and provides a feeling of commonality and affiliation. For businesses it offers the opportunity to create a \"forever customer\" who remains loyal and participatory, even as the company shifts and changes. Membership allows for building direct relationships and continuously generates a data stream that can be tapped for a variety of purposes. </p> <p>Ultimately it provides the cachet of belonging. </p>";
