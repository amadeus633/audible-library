Metaverse is ever-expanding and is quickly moving on to other areas which will include things like cryptocurrencies, NFT’s, and other investments.</p> <p>Metaverse is the future! It’s planned to be the next big thing in Crypto, in fact, many leaders claim it's going to be the next stage of the internet. Facebook (one of the biggest companies in the world) have so much trust in it they have changed their business name to “Meta”!</p> <p>In this Merverse audiobook you will discover:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Top crypto fit with the Metaverse</li> <li>The change of the web</li> <li>Key concepts of the Metaverse</li> <li>New business models of the Web 3.0</li> <li>Real estate investing in the Metaverse</li> <li>Altcoins and cryptocurrencies</li> <li>How to make a profit in the Metaverse</li> <li>Using the Metaverse for networking</li> <li>What exactly is the Metaverse?</li> <li>How can we make money with it?</li> <li>Virtual reality in the Metaverse</li> <li>How augmented reality works in the Metaverse</li> <li>The investment of NFT’s in the Metaverse</li> <li>Avoid risks and challenges in the Metaverse</li> <li>The future of the Metaserve</li> </ul> <p>This audiobook contains all of the technological advancements that are hastening the breakdown of the physical-virtual divide. The Metaverse is more than just virtual worlds; it's a place where the physical is transformed virtually through digital twins and mirror worlds, and the virtual is rendered tangible by data overlaying on physical locations and items via augmented reality and haptic, as well as 3D printing.</p> <p>This Metaverse openness or interoperability will be a challenge for today's big digital corporations, who have built and operated private platforms where customers are essentially trapped in \"walled gardens\", and their personal data is monetized.</p> <p>This is where cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin, as well as blockchain technology, come into play. Blockchain, a distributed ledger, is naturally decentralized and, in theory, can give people more control over their data while also allowing small businesses to thrive online through smart contracts and other means.</p> <p>Cryptocurrencies incentivize users to maintain the blockchain for the greater good, based on codified laws and governance, resulting in a tokenized economy that threatens to disrupt everything from banks and legal companies to traditional government structures and organizations.</p> <p>Buy this audiobook now!</p>";
